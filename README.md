## Description

Missionary and Cannibals is a console-based game where players embark on a mission to move characters (missionaries and cannibals) across a river using a boat. The game focuses on strategic moves to ensure the safety of missionaries and prevent cannibals from outnumbering them.

3. During the game:
   - You will be prompted to enter characters (M for Missionary, C for Cannibal) separated by commas to move characters to the other side.
   - You can only move up to two characters at a time.
  
4. The game ends when either:
   - You successfully move three missionaries and three cannibals to the other side.
   - The number of cannibals exceeds the number of missionaries on either side.
